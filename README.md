# CycloneDX PHP Library

Work with Bill of Materials (BOM) in [CycloneDX] format.

## Responsibilities

* Provide a general purpose _php_-implementation of [_CycloneDX_][CycloneDX].
* Provide [_phpDoc3_](https://phpdoc.org/)- & [_psalm_](https://psalm.dev/)-compatible annotations for said implementation,
  so developers and dev-tools can rely on it.
* Provide data models to work with _CycloneDX_.
* Provide a JSON- and an XML-normalizer, that...
  * supports all shipped data models.
  * respects any injected [_CycloneDX_ Specification][CycloneDX-spec] and generates valid output according to it.
  * can prepare data structures for JSON- and XML-serialization.
* Serialization:
  * Provide a JSON-serializer.
  * Provide an XML-serializer.
* Validation against _CycloneDX_ Specification:
  * Provide a JSON-validator.
  * Provide an XML-validator.
* Provide [_composer_-based autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) for downstream usage.

## Capabilities

* Enums for the following use cases:
  * `ComponentType`
  * `ExternalReferenceType`
  * `HashAlgorithm`
* Data models for the following use cases:
  * `Bom`
  * `BomRef`, `BomRefRepository`
  * `Component`, `ComponentRepository`, `ComponentEvidence`
  * `ExternalReference`, `ExternalReferenceRepository`
  * `HashDictionary`
  * `LicenseExpression`, `NamedLicense`, `SpdxLicense`, `LicenseRepository`
  * `Metadata`
  * `Property`, `PropertyRepository`
  * `Tool`, `ToolRepository`
* Utilities for the following use cases:
  * Generate valid random SerialNumbers for `Bom.serialNumber`
* Factories for the following use cases:
  * Create data models from any license descriptor string
* Implementation of the [_CycloneDX_ Specification][CycloneDX-spec] for the following versions:
  * `1.4`
  * `1.3`
  * `1.2`
  * `1.1`
* Normalizers that convert data models to JSON structures
* Normalizers that convert data models to  XML structures
* Serializer that converts `Bom` data models to JSON string
* Serializer that converts `Bom` data models to  XML string
* Validator that checks JSON against _CycloneDX_ Specification
* Validator that checks  XML against _CycloneDX_ Specification

## Installation

Install via composer:

```shell
composer require cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library
```

## Usage

See extended [examples].

```php
$bom = new \CycloneDX\Core\Models\Bom();
$bom->getComponents()->addItems(
    new \CycloneDX\Core\Models\Component(
        \CycloneDX\Core\Enums\ComponentType::Library,
        'myComponent'
    )
);
```

## API Documentation

There is no pre-rendered documentation at the time.  
Instead, there are code annotations, so that your IDE and tools may pick up the documentation when you use this library downstream.

Additionally, there is a prepared config for [_phpDoc3_](https://docs.phpdoc.org/guide/getting-started/index.html)
that you can use to generate the docs for yourself.

## Conflicts

Due to the fact that this library was split out of [`/src/Core` of cyclonedx-php-composer (346e6200fb2f5086061b15c2ee44f540893ce97d)](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-php-composer/tree/346e6200fb2f5086061b15c2ee44f540893ce97d/src/Core)
it will conflict with its original source: `cyclonedx/cyclonedx-php-composer:<3.5`.
