    This is considered a non-breaking change, because the types were already correctly annotated.  
  * Migrated internals to PHP8 language features ([#114] via [#125])

### API changes v2 - the details

* Overall
  * BREAKING: enforced the use of concrete UnionTypes instead of protocols/interfaces/abstracts ([#114] via [#125])  
    Affected the usages of no longer public `\CycloneDX\Core\Models\License\AbstractDisjunctiveLicense` and methods that used license-related classes.
    This was possible due to PHP8's UnionType language feature.
  * Changed some methods to no longer throw `\InvalidArgumentException` (via [#125])  
    PhpDoc annotations were updated, so that code analysis tools should pick up.
    This was possible by enforcing correct typing on PHP8 language level.
  * BREAKING: every occurrence of `{M,m}etaData` with a capital "D" was renamed to `{M,m}etadata` with a small "d" ([#133] via [#131], [#149])  
    This affects class names, method names, variable names, property names, file names, documentation - everything.

    * BREAKING: removed method `makeForHashRepositonary()` - use `makeForHashDictionary()` instead ([#133] via [#131])
    * BREAKING: removed method `setSpec()` (via [#131])
    * Added new method `makeForComponentEvidence()` ([#238] via [#241])
    * Added new method `makeForHashDictionary()` ([#133] via [#131])
    * Added new method `makeForLicense()` (via [#131])
    * Added new method `makeForLicenseRepository()` (via [#131])
  * `{DOM,JSON}\Normalizers` namespaces
    * BREAKING: removed classes `DisjunctiveLicenseNormalizer` - use `LicenseNormalizer` instead (via [#131])
    * BREAKING: removed classes `LicenseExpressionNormalizer`  - use `LicenseNormalizer` instead (via [#131])
    * BREAKING: removed classes `DisjunctiveLicenseRepositoryNormalizer` (via [#131])
    * BREAKING: renamed classes `HashRepositoryNormalizer` -> `HashDictionaryNormalizer` ([#133] via [#131])  
      Also changed signatures to accept `Models\HashDictionary` instead of `Models\HashRepository`
    * BREAKING: changed signatures of class `HashNormalizer` to accept native PHP Enumeration type `\CycloneDX\Core\Enum\HashAlgorithm` ([#140] via [#204])

      * Changed the method `normalize()` to actually throw `\DomainException` when `\ExternalReference`'s type was not supported by the spec (via [#65])  
        This is considered a non-breaking change, because the behaviour was already documented in the API, even though there was no need for an implementation before.
